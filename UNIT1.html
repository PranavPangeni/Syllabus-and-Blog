                <h2>Components of Computer System</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Input:</b> Devices that allow users to enter data (e.g., Keyboard, Mouse).</li>
                    <li><b>Output:</b> Devices that present processed data (e.g., Monitor, Printer).</li>
                    <li><b>Processing:</b> The CPU processes data and executes instructions.</li>
                    <li><b>Storage:</b> Devices that store data (e.g., Hard Drive, SSD, RAM).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Classification of Computers Based on Size</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Super Computer:</b> This computer are one of the fastest and powerful digital computer which can perform only a particular types of jobs such as weather forecasting, rocket launching, population counting etc. They were tremendously huge in size and are very expensive. Due to this reason they are not commercially successful. They are used by large corporations and government agencies. They were large in size hence, it occupy much more space and require temperature controlled room.</li>
                    <li><b>Mainframe Computer:</b> This computer are also largest, fastest and perhaps one of the most expensive computer. Super computer are much more powerful and expensive but they are similar in size with mainframe computers. These computers have high processing unit and large storage capacity. This computer have multiple terminal. This computer can do big capacity of processing tasks such as population census, agro census, SLC result processing, governmental offices, industries etc. The first computer bought in Nepal in 2028 BS was IBM 1401, which was also a mainframe computer. This computer was bought in Nepal for population counting. Moreover, second computer bought in Nepal was ICL 2950/10 in 2038 BS which was also a mainframe computer brought for same purpose.</li>
                    <li><b>Mini Computer:</b> This computer are smaller than mainframe computer and are more powerful and expensive compare with micro-computer. They use terminal and are connected with more than 50 terminal at a time. Hence, it can handle much more amount of input and output than micro computer. The capability of mini computer is somewhere in between mainframe and micro computer. So, they are often called mid-range computer. This computer are used for medium size business, industries, universities, banks due to easy operation than mainframe computer. Eg, Data general, NECK, MAGNUM</li>
                    <li><b>Micro Computer:</b> These are the smallest computer develop till date they use micro-processor as their major processing unit. Hence, they are called micro-computers. This computer are small and low cost digital computer. They are also called home computer or personal computer. This days we can find various micro computer that has various processing speed, storage, capacity and size according to cost. They are normally used in office, home, school, shop etc. Micro Computer are also found in various shape and size. They are desktop, Laptop and palmtop.</li>

            <div class="question">1. What is an input device?</div>
            <p>An input device allows users to enter data into a computer, such as a keyboard or mouse.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="question">2. What is the function of the CPU?</div>
            <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) performs the following functions:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Fetch:</b> Retrieves instructions from memory.</li>
                    <li><b>Decode:</b> Converts instructions into signals.</li>
                    <li><b>Execute:</b> Carries out the instructions.</li>
                    <li><b>Store:</b> Saves the processed data in memory.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="question">3. What is the binary number system?</div>
            <p>Binary is a base-2 number system using only 0s and 1s. It is essential for computing because:
                <ul>
                    <li>It represents electrical states (ON/OFF).</li>
                    <li>It is used in data storage and processing.</li>
                    <li>It simplifies digital logic circuits.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="question">4. How do computers store data?</div>
            <p>Computers store data in multiple ways:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Primary Storage:</b> RAM and Cache, for temporary storage.</li>
                    <li><b>Secondary Storage:</b> Hard Drives and SSDs for permanent storage.</li>
                    <li><b>Cloud Storage:</b> Online servers for remote data access.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="question">5. What are the types of computers based on size?</div>
            <p>Computers are classified into four main categories:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Supercomputers:</b> Used for complex calculations like weather forecasting.</li>
                    <li><b>Mainframe Computers:</b> Used by large organizations for bulk data processing.</li>
                    <li><b>Minicomputers:</b> Mid-sized computers used in businesses.</li>
                    <li><b>Microcomputers:</b> Personal computers, including desktops and laptops.</li>
                </ul>
